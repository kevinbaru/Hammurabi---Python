# Hammurabi---Python
This is a python implementation of an old computer game called Hammurabi -http://www.hammurabigame.com/hammurabi-game.php.
As the hammurabi, you play this game to try and increase the wealth of your kingdom
#### Rules
The game lasts 10 years, with a year being one turn. <br/>
Each year, enter how many bushels of grain to allocate to buying (or selling) acres of land, feeding your population, and planting crops for the next year.<br/>
Each person needs 20 bushels of grain each year to live and can till at most 10 acres of land.<br/>
Each acre of land requires one bushel of grain to plant seeds.<br/>
The price of each acre of land fluctuates from 17 bushels per acre to 26 bushels.<br/>
If the conditions in your country ever become bad enough, the people will overthrow you and you won't finish your 10 year term.<br/>
If you make it to the 11th year, your rule will be evaluated and you'll be ranked against great figures in history.<br/>
#### To play the game run it on any code editor
